The convex hull of formation enthalpy is a central tool in materials thermodynamics.

# What is the convex hull?

Given a set of compositions \(x_i\) and formation enthalpies \(\Delta H_i\), the **convex hull** is the set of all structures that cannot be expressed as a mixture of other structures with lower energy.

A structure lies:

- **On the hull** → thermodynamically stable  
- **Above the hull** → metastable (energy above ground-state envelope)

# Formation Enthalpy Definition

For a composition with stoichiometry \( \{n_i\} \):

\[
\Delta H_f =
\frac{
H_{\text{tot}}
- \sum_i n_i \mu_i
- \sum_{X \in \text{diatomics}} \frac{n_X}{2}H_{X_2}
}{
N_{\text{atoms}} }
\]

### Where:
- \(H_{\text{tot}}\): enthalpy from ML or DFT  
- \(\mu_i\): elemental enthalpy per atom  
- \(H_{X_2}\): enthalpy of molecular references (e.g., H₂)  
- \(N_{\text{atoms}}\): atoms in simulation cell

# Why hull analysis?

1. Identifies **stable phases**  
2. Determines **phase boundaries**  
3. Reveals **pressure-driven stabilization**  
4. Guides **DFT validation choices**  
5. Reduces computational cost

# Ternary Hull Visualization

We use **python-ternary** with axis-order mapping:

- Left vertex = element A  
- Right vertex = element B  
- Bottom vertex = element C  

Coordinates map fractions via:

\[
(x, y, z) \rightarrow (C\%, B\%, A\%)
\]

Colors represent formation enthalpy.

# Summary

Convex hulls provide a clear window into:
- stability  
- metastability  
- structure–composition relationships  
- phase transitions
