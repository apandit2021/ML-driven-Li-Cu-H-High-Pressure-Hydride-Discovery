# Results Summary: Li–Cu–H Convex Hulls Across 0–100 GPa

This document summarizes the major physical and computational findings from the Li–Cu–H ternary hydride search.

---

# 1. Overview

- MatterGen + MatterSim generated a diverse structural dataset.
- DFT validated which structures are truly stable.
- ML hulls and DFT hulls agree very well, with small shifts.
- Pressure dramatically changes thermodynamics.

Representative hulls from ML and DFT are included in:
